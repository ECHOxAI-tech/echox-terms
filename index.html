  <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
  <p>These Terms & Conditions apply to all photography sessions conducted by the artist known as <strong>ECHOx</strong> (also represented through official accounts such as <em>@berlinechoes</em> on Instagram). By booking, participating in, or accepting delivery of photographs, you agree to the following terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Scope</h2>
  <p>These Terms apply to both paid and unpaid (informal) photo sessions, and extend to all previously taken pictures by ECHOx.</p>

  <h2>2. Copyright and Usage</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All copyrights remain with ECHOx.</li>
    <li>By participating in a photo session (paid or unpaid), you grant ECHOx the explicit right to publish, exhibit, and use the photographs online, in exhibitions, portfolios, printed materials, and other artistic contexts.</li>
    <li>Clients may not use the photographs for commercial purposes without prior written consent from ECHOx.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Attribution</h2>
  <p>In all official or public contexts, the artist must be referred to as <strong>ECHOx</strong> or by one of the official accounts (currently <em>@berlinechoes</em> on Instagram). The legal identity behind ECHOx is K. E. Haakansson, Berlin.</p>

  <h2>4. Pricing & Payment</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-booked and confirmed shoots have a starting fee of €100, including 8–12 high-resolution digital scans delivered via WeTransfer.</li>
    <li>Signed originals (limited edition of 1) start at €60 each. Discounts may be available for multiple purchases on request.</li>
    <li>Payment is due within 7 (seven) calendar days of invoice. If payment is not received within this period, ECHOx reserves the right to initiate legal proceedings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Clients share responsibility for the outcome of a session. Weather, sunlight, or other conditions cannot be guaranteed.</li>
    <li>If special wishes or requirements exist (such as specific backdrops or locations), the client must assist in identifying suitable options and planning in advance.</li>
    <li>Punctuality is essential. Missed opportunities due to lateness are the client’s responsibility.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Artistic Autonomy</h2>
  <p>ECHOx reserves full artistic discretion in the process of photographing, selecting, and editing. Moral rights as the author of the work remain intact at all times.</p>
